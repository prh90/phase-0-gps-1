   1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
   This was my first session, but I did struggle with git commands and shortcuts like history. Fetch, push. 

   2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
   Branching, branch switching, commit messages, Github. Pushing history into sublime. Auto fill directories and commnad line. Working with my pair Mo really helped me learn more about each concept. 

   3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
   I asked Mo about syntax correctness. Asked Neal about 
   commit messages. 

   4. What still confuses you about Git?
   More of pushing to github. Can I push one branch and Mo 
   another to have 2 separate branches uploaded without any problems?


   5.How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
   It was pretty cool. I feel like I tried to do it too fast
   and forgot to stay calm and take it slow.
