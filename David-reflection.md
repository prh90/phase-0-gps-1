1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    * git checkout : changing a branch

    * git fetch - fetching latest history from serve.
    * git push origin master - send changes to remote repository. 
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    * branch switching
    * more detailed commit messages
    * github in general
    * advanced history command / pushing history into sublime
    * autofill directory in command line
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    I asked Neal about descriptiveness of commit message, and also general GPS question.
4. What still confuses you about Git?
    Merging - what happens when two different developers merge different commits to a master?
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    It was pretty cool. The pace could have been better.
